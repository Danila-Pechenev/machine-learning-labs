# Machine Learning Labs – MSc Data Science, Centrale Lille

This repository contains lab assignments from multiple **Machine Learning** courses taken during the MSc in Data Science program at Centrale Lille (2025-2026).

The labs focus on hands-on implementation of classical and modern machine learning algorithms, model evaluation techniques, and optimization methods using Python.
